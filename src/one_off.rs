/// requested with an HTTP GET method. Such a request can be done before deciding to download a
/// large resource to save bandwidth, for example.
///
/// A response to a HEAD method should not have a body. If so, it must be ignored. Even so, entity
/// headers describing the content of the body, like Content-Length may be included in the
/// response. They don't relate to the body of the HEAD response, which should be empty, but to the
/// body of similar request using the GET method would have returned as a response.
///
/// If the result of a HEAD request shows that a cached resource after a GET request is now
/// outdated, the cache is invalidated, even if no GET request has been made.

/// Perform a one-off `POST` request.
///
/// # About the HTTP Method
///
/// The HTTP POST method sends data to the server. The type of the body of the request is indicated
/// by the Content-Type header.
///
/// The difference between PUT and POST is that PUT is idempotent: calling it once or several times
/// successively has the same effect (that is no side effect), where successive identical POST may
/// have additional effects, like passing an order several times.
///
/// A POST request is typically sent via an HTML form and results in a change on the server. In
/// this case, the content type is selected by putting the adequate string in the enctype attribute
/// of the `<form>` element or the formenctype attribute of the `<input>` or `<button>` elements:
///
/// ```txt
/// application/x-www-form-urlencoded: the keys and values are encoded in key-value tuples separated by '&', with a '=' between the key and the value. Non-alphanumeric characters in both keys and values are percent encoded: this is the reason why this type is not suitable to use with binary data (use multipart/form-data instead)
/// multipart/form-data: each value is sent as a block of data ("body part"), with a user agent-defined delimiter ("boundary") separating each part. The keys are given in the Content-Disposition header of each part.
/// text/plain
/// ```
///
/// When the POST request is sent via a method other than an HTML form — like via an XMLHttpRequest
/// — the body can take any type. As described in the HTTP 1.1 specification, POST is designed to
/// allow a uniform method to cover the following functions:
///
/// ```txt
/// Annotation of existing resources
/// Posting a message to a bulletin board, newsgroup, mailing list, or similar group of articles;
/// Adding a new user through a signup modal;
/// Providing a block of data, such as the result of submitting a form, to a data-handling process;
/// Extending a database through an append operation.

/// # About the HTTP Method
///
/// The HTTP CONNECT method method starts two-way communications with the requested resource. It

///
/// For example, the CONNECT method can be used to access websites that use SSL (HTTPS). The client
/// asks an HTTP Proxy server to tunnel the TCP connection to the desired destination. The server
/// then proceeds to make the connection on behalf of the client. Once the connection has been
/// established by the server, the Proxy server continues to proxy the TCP stream to and from the
/// client.
///
/// CONNECT is a hop-by-hop method.

/// is possible to issue PATCH requests in such a way as to be idempotent.
///
/// PATCH (like PUT) may have side-effects on other resources.
///
/// To find out whether a server supports PATCH, a server can advertise its support by adding it to
/// the list in the Allow or Access-Control-Allow-Methods (for CORS) response headers.
///
/// Another (implicit) indication that PATCH is allowed, is the presence of the Accept-Patch
/// header, which specifies the patch document formats accepted by the server.
